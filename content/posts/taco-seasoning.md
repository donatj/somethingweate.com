So one of my white whales (I have many) is taco seasoning. Growing up in northern MN, "tacos" always meant ground beef + packet of taco seasoning.
Sure you can mix in veggies, hard/soft shells, lettuce for taco salad, blah blah blah. That's what tacos always were to me. Then I found [Nacho's](http://nachomexicangrill.com/).

Before I go any further, let me say that their logo does *not* represent the food, atmosphere, or people at Nacho's. The site looks like an updated Don Pablo's (greasy Ameri-Mexi food chain).
Nacho's is small cafe run by a Mexican family that does one thing, and one thing well--make Mexican food like you're in Mexico. It is, without reservation, the best Mexican street food I've
ever had. Since I prefer blue collar street food to the gastro-nonsense consuming the world, calling it street food is a compliment. Tacos here are a corn tortilla, a protein, onion, and cilantro.
Period. Don't ask for cheese, it's insulting to tacos (although they're nice people and will give it to you with a smile). Nacho's tacos are a class in what defines good food. Solid
ingredients, elbow grease, and simplicity.

That being said, there are days when I'm running a little low on time (and elbow grease) and long for the days of my youth when tacos were only a half step removed from casserole.
To that end, I've been searching for a good DIY spice mix that could compete with the nostalgia of a [Ortega](http://a.co/bm2GZUi) or [Old El Paso](http://a.co/bpHKxpV). I've used a couple
and they can do in a pinch. Last night I used [this one](http://www.rachelcooks.com/2011/10/28/homemade-taco-seasoning/) and have played with [this one](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/abs-chili-powder-recipe-1943055).
But my quest continues.

*Sidenote*: The [Alton Brown](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/abs-chili-powder-recipe-1943055) one actually got me chasing my own chili powder which I use all over the place. I'll
write something about it sometime.
