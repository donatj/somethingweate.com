If you're going to organize your recipes any one way, I'd like to recommend [onetsp](https://onetsp.com). They are a
very affordable, on-line recipe manager that hits all the geek buttons (markdown, web clipper, extra notes, export, et. al.).

I've been a happy customer for a few years and the only complaint I have is the inability to alter tags in bulk. You can
share recipes via email. Overall, if you're looking to digitize your recipes, this is the tool I'd recommend.
