Hey there! How are you?

### Oh, you want to know about me?

Since you ask, I'm going to take second to tell you a bit about me. By day I'm
a developer. This should be obvious from the "social" link for [Github](http://henderjon.com). That's where
I keep all the code I write. Around the time my boys turned three years old, I got the
itch to make. It's not uncommon for developers (and everyone else) to want to take a
step back and do something menial, monotonous, and engaging to our core motor skills.
Sitting a desk writing `foreach` loops every day is actually soul crushing. My dad
is an amazing maker. His garage is gigantic with every tool ever. He's spent a lifetime
of futzing around fixing, making, inventing, learning, and gathering the tools and
skills to exploit that garage. He lives on 35 acres of rural country.

I live on 1/4 acre of city suburb. Aside from not having the physical space or the financial
means to accumulate anything near what my dad has. Further, and this kills me to this day, I never
respected my formative years with him to learn what he knows. Being a maker will need to look
different for me.

Enter cooking. I enjoy cooking. I love cooking. Since I don't cool for a living, I found
the monotony of vegetable prep soothing and life affirming. Mix that with some good food TV and
documentaries, the fire was lit. It wasn't until I realized that being the in the kitchen
was my maker space. I *did* have the equipment and I had the time (three kids and a wife need to
eat--everyday it seems). I picked up a couple of [books](posts/books-ive-read/) that *finally*
started talking about how to understand cooking, not just how to make recipes.

I'm not saying I'm any good. I'm not. But it's *my* maker space and I get to succeed and fail
therein. My stove is *old* and stained. It looks dirty and is not photogenic in the least. In fact
it looks worse in pictures than it does in real life. My kitchen in long and narrow and is the
main corridor for foot traffic coming in and out of the house (three kids and a wife go in and
out--everyday it seems). But I think I finally found a place where I get to make something.

I'm a developer and so this blog is low tech because I'm in to low tech. If I have pics, they'll
be on [instagram](https://instagram.com/somethingweate). I'm not trying to be the next
youtube food channel darling, I'm simply enjoying the making, and joy is only complete if
it's shared.
