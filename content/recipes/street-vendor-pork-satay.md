### INGREDIENTS

  - 1 Tbsp curry powder
  - 1/2 Tbsp pepper
  - 1 Tbsp salt
  - 1 Tbsp sugar
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/4 C coconut milk
  - 2 lbs pork shoulder or loin

### DIRECTIONS

  1. Combine all spices and coconut milk.
  2. Slice the pork against the grain into 2" square tiles about 1/4" thick. Add marinade and gently massage to cover the meat. Allow to marinate for up to 12 hours.
  3. Grill.

### NOTES

Would go very well with a peanut sauce.

I sliced the pork a bit thicker (1/2") and it worked very well.

The next time I make this I'm going to use greek yogurt instead of coconut milk.
