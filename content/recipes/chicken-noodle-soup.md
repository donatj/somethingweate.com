- Half bag (~8oz) of amish homestyle egg noodles<sup>1</sup>
- 1 large yellow onion
- ~1.5-2 lbs dark meat<sup>2</sup> chicken with skin and bones.
- 3 large carrots
- 4 stalks of celery
- 1-2 bayleaves
- Paprika - *optional*
- 2-3 Saffron Threads - *optional*
- Salt
- Pepper

## Broth

In a large pot, add all of your chicken. It is important to leave the skin and bones on as they provide much of the flavor for the broth. Break a stalk of celery in half and add to the pot. Then, take the large onion leaving the skin on, quarter, and place in the pot. Add a dash of salt and pepper.

Let boil on medium heat for 20-30 minutes until chicken is cooked through.

Once the chicken has cooked through, toss the onion and celery; remove chicken from broth and set aside to cool.

Optionally, using a large spoon you may now skim the fat from the broth.

## Soup

Add half bag of homestyle egg noodles to the pot. Let boil until soft (~8-10 minutes)

While that cooks, remove skin and cut carrots into circles and slice remaining celery.

Now that the chicken has cooled, remove skin, bones and other undesirables from the chicken, leaving just the meat. Chop the remaining meat into small bitesize pieces. Again set the chicken aside.

Once the noodles have softened, add the bayleaves, saffron, sliced carrots and celery to the pot. Continue to cook on a low boil until the carrots and celery are only slightly firm (~6-10 minutes).

Add the chicken to the pot continuing to boil until carrots and celery are soft.

After a minute or so of boiling, salt and pepper the soup to taste. The noodles will suck up some of the salt you add so you may need to add more. Paprika may optionally be added at this point for color.

Once the carrots and celery are soft it is ready to serve.

Enjoy.

### Notes

1. See: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Essenhaus-Country-Homemade-Noodles-16-Ounce/dp/B000H27IBK/) for an example. Similar bags of noodles are available in almost all reputible grocery stores.
2. While you certainly *can* use white meat for picky eaters, it makes *mediocre broth* and I wouldn't recommend it.
