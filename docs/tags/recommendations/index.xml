      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re going to organize your recipes any one way, I&amp;rsquo;d like to recommend onetsp. They are a very affordable, on-line recipe manager that hits all the geek buttons (markdown, web clipper, extra notes, export, et. al.).
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a happy customer for a few years and the only complaint I have is the inability to alter tags in bulk. You can share recipes via email. Overall, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to digitize your recipes, this is the tool I&amp;rsquo;d recommend.</description>

      <title>Books I&#39;ve Read</title>

      <description>Every now and then, I see someone asking about good books. Further, I often can&amp;rsquo;t call to mind some of the better books I&amp;rsquo;ve read in the moment. To that end, I&amp;rsquo;m going to list out some of the better books I&amp;rsquo;ve read. Keep in mind, I mostly read non-fiction so the number of fiction books to call upon is pretty slim.
In no particular order, these are some books I would recommend.</description>
