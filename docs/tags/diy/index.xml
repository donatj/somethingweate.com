      <description>Tonight I made shawarma. It was pretty good. The lemon was a bit strong. &amp;ldquo;The juice of 1 lemon&amp;rdquo; is pretty subjective and I overestimated. It did soak for 24 hours and had certainly started to cure. It cooked up fine, tasted great, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be making it again. The spice mix came out like a really earthy curry (thanks cumin). I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the ingredients for the salad so it ended up being hummus, onion, cucumber, and pita.</description>

      <description>So one of my white whales (I have many) is taco seasoning. Growing up in northern MN, &amp;ldquo;tacos&amp;rdquo; always meant ground beef + packet of taco seasoning. Sure you can mix in veggies, hard/soft shells, lettuce for taco salad, blah blah blah. That&amp;rsquo;s what tacos always were to me. Then I found Nacho&amp;rsquo;s.
Before I go any further, let me say that their logo does not represent the food, atmosphere, or people at Nacho&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <title>Peach Jam</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of fun discovering Jam (and by extension, preserving). It was largely inspired by a video series on tastemade. Kevin West taught the class on jam based entirely on his book Saving The Season. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic video series and the book is great. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly nice that he goes into explaining jam. I like to understand what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and really hate recipe books that just give you recipes without teaching you to understand what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.</description>
