      <description>Tonight I made shawarma. It was pretty good. The lemon was a bit strong. &amp;ldquo;The juice of 1 lemon&amp;rdquo; is pretty subjective and I overestimated. It did soak for 24 hours and had certainly started to cure. It cooked up fine, tasted great, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be making it again. The spice mix came out like a really earthy curry (thanks cumin). I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the ingredients for the salad so it ended up being hummus, onion, cucumber, and pita.</description>
