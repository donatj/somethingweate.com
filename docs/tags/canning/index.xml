      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of fun discovering Jam (and by extension, preserving). It was largely inspired by a video series on tastemade. Kevin West taught the class on jam based entirely on his book Saving The Season. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic video series and the book is great. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly nice that he goes into explaining jam. I like to understand what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and really hate recipe books that just give you recipes without teaching you to understand what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.</description>
