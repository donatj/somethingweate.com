<p>Tonight I made <a href="https://www.tastemade.com/videos/cheaters-shawarma">shawarma</a>. It was pretty good. The lemon
was a bit strong. &ldquo;The juice of 1 lemon&rdquo; is pretty subjective and I overestimated. It did soak for 24 hours
and had certainly started to cure. It cooked up fine, tasted great, and I&rsquo;ll be making it again. The spice mix
came out like a really earthy curry (thanks cumin). I didn&rsquo;t have the ingredients for the salad so it ended up
being hummus, onion, cucumber, and pita. Solid meal, but overall it felt two-dimensional. Next time, I&rsquo;ll make
sure to have everything I need on hand.</p>

<p>I also made hummus without a recipe. This was exciting because, in the past, when I go off script it
usually turns out poorly. Two things I did differently. First, I used the <a href="http://aquafaba.com/">aquafaba</a>. I will do this again.
Second, I didn&rsquo;t have any lemons so I used a splash of white wine vinegar. It worked. Next time I&rsquo;ll go back
to using lemons, but the fact that it worked was both surprising and encouraging.</p>

<p>Lastly, I made caesar dressing again. This time I tried using fish sauce instead of anchovy fillets. The irritating bit
as with the hummus was my lack of lemon. So, I had to rely on white wine vinegar. I dialed up the worcestershire sauce because it&rsquo;s so
good. I also went for the commodity cheese. The green plastic tube, at first, didn&rsquo;t look like it would work. I&rsquo;ll
drop it on a salad tomorrow and let you know. No lemon, cheaper cheese, and fish sauce. I&rsquo;ll keep you posted.</p>

<p>[update]</p>

<h3 id="re-the-caesar-dressing">re: the caesar dressing.</h3>

<p>It ended up decent. The fish sauce came through as fish sauce. It&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t bad, but certainly tasted not-quite-caesar.
I think in a pinch, it&rsquo;d work, but if you can actually get anchovies, do so. The wildcard is that I&rsquo;m not sure if
having lemon juice would&rsquo;ve helped. In either case, I&rsquo;ll stick to the anchovies.</p>
